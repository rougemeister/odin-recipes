    <h2>A delicious bowl of Jollof Rice with fried Ripe Plantain</h2>
    <p><strong><em>Jollof rice</em></strong>, is a rice dish from West Africa.</p>
    <p>The dish is typically made with long-grain rice, tomatoes, onions, spices, vegetables and meat in a single pot, although its ingredients and preparation methods vary across different regions.</p>

    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 medium sized Roma tomatoes, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1 medium sized onion, roughly chopped, set aside</li>
        <li> 2 scotch bonnet peppers (habanero peppers as they are sometimes called)</li>
        <li> 1/4 cup of groundnut oil</li>
        <li> tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li> 2 cups of parboiled rice</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups of chicken stock</li>
        <li>tsp salt to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp curry powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp thyme</li>
        <li>1 tsp All purpose seasoning</li>
        <li>1 Knorr stock cube</li>
        <li>3 bay leaves</li>
        <li>Water, as needed</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a blender, combine tomatoes, scotch bonnet pepper and onions; purée. 
        <li>Pour out half the purée into a bowl; set aside. 
        <li>Add the bell peppers to the purée remaining in the blender and pulse until smooth. 
        <li>Add to the mixture that was set aside and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. 
        <li>Add blended vegetables along with the salt, curry powder, ground chile pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, bay leaves, ginger and thyme. 
        <li>Bring mixture to a boil.</li>
        <li>Stir in the rice until well mixed, then reduce the heat to low.</li>
        <li>Cover pot and let cook until rice is al dente, about 45 minutes. 
        <li>Check after 30 minutes; if rice is sauce-logged, remove the lid to cook off the excess sauce. 
        <li>If rice seems dry, stir in 1 to 2 cups water. 
        <li>Allow the rice at the bottom of the pot to char a bit to infuse it with a smoky flavor.</li>

        <li>Hot cooked white rice or fufu, to serve (see notes)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
        In a blender, purée 2 onion halves, 1/2 cup (120ml) chicken stock, 3 garlic cloves, 1/2 ounce ginger, and tomato paste. 
    </li>
        <li>
        In a Dutch oven, combine chicken legs with purée, remaining onion halves, remaining 1/2 ounce ginger, and remaining 2 cloves garlic, 
        along with hot pepper and bay leaves. 
    </li>
        <li>
        Toss to coat.
    </li>
        <li>
        Set Dutch oven over medium heat and bring to a simmer, then cover, reduce heat to low, 
        and cook until halved onion is soft and translucent, about 20 minutes. 
    </li>
        <li>
        Add an extra 1/2 cup (120ml) chicken stock if mixture begins to stick to the bottom of the pot.
    </li>

        <li>
        Transfer chunks of onion, ginger, garlic cloves, and hot pepper to blender. 
    </li>
        <li>
        Add peanut butter, canned tomatoes and their juices, and remaining 1 1/2 cups (360ml) chicken 
        stock and purée until smooth. 
    </li>
        <li>
        Pass blended mix through a fine-mesh strainer into the Dutch oven, stirring to incorporate.
    </li>

        <li>
        Increase heat to medium and bring to a simmer. 
    </li>
        <li>Lower heat to medium-low and cook.

    </li>
        <li>
        Stir occasionally, until chicken is tender, oils have surfaced, 
        and mixture has thickened and reduced by about one-third. 
    </li> 
        <li>
        Add smoked fish, reduce heat to low, cover pot, and cook an additional 5 minutes. 
    </li>
